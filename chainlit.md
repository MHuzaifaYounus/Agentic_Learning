## üöÄ How It Works

### **Intelligent Agent Orchestration**
Our platform employs a sophisticated multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to deliver optimal learning experiences:

#### **1. Main Agent (Intake & Coordination)**
- **Role**: First point of contact and conversation coordinator
- **Function**: Greets users, collects learning preferences, and orchestrates the entire workflow
- **Key Features**:
  - No default assumptions - gathers all required information
  - Collects: topic, knowledge level, learning goals, constraints, and prior knowledge
  - Maintains conversation context through intelligent summarization
  - Seamlessly hands off to specialized agents

#### **2. Planner Agent (Learning Architecture)**
- **Role**: Educational architect and curriculum designer
- **Function**: Creates structured learning plans tailored to user expertise
- **Intelligence**:
  - **Beginner Level**: Intuition-first approach with concrete examples and minimal jargon
  - **Intermediate Level**: Balanced intuition and formalism with practical applications
  - **Advanced Level**: Formal definitions, equations, edge cases, and complexity analysis
  - **Simple Topics**: Enforces Introduction ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Common Questions structure
  - **Complex Topics**: Foundations ‚Üí Core Concepts ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Pitfalls ‚Üí Recap

#### **3. Teacher Agent (Expert Instructor)**
- **Role**: Passionate professor delivering clear, engaging explanations
- **Function**: Explains each subtopic with pedagogical excellence
- **Teaching Methodology**:
  - **Orientation**: Clear learning objectives and relevance
  - **Prerequisite Primer**: Background knowledge refresh when needed
  - **Core Explanation**: Step-by-step concept building with examples
  - **Common Pitfalls**: Addresses misconceptions proactively
  - **Mini Recap**: Plain-language summaries
  - **Self-Check**: Mental exercises for knowledge validation
  - **References**: Curated resources for deeper learning

#### **4. Summarizer Agent (Context Management)**
- **Role**: Conversation memory and context optimizer
- **Function**: Maintains rolling summaries to ensure continuity
- **Benefits**:
  - Preserves learning progress across sessions
  - Optimizes token usage for cost efficiency
  - Maintains conversation coherence
  - Enables seamless topic transitions
